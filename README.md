# Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm in Java

This project implements Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm in Java. The algorithm approximates the closest lattice vector to a given target vector, making it a useful tool for studying lattice-based cryptography.

## Project Context
This code is part of a discrete mathematics project focused on lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptography is a promising area in post-quantum cryptography due to its resistance to quantum computer attacks.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using any Java IDE or from the terminal:
   ```bash
   javac BabaiApproximation.java
